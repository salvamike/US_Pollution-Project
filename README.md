# Project
Based on nearly two decades worth of air quality data, can we determine the top 5 most polluted cities/states and predict their future air quality 

# Research Questions
1. What are the top 5 most polluted cities/states based on historic data?
2. What are the top 5 most polluted cities/states for each four air pollutants based on historic data?
3. Can we predict the next 10-years of pollution levels based on historic data?

# Why We Selected Topic
All members live in the greater Northern Utah area and have an interest in air quality and pollution, as this is a common issue among locals.

# Data Source
A CSV file with over 1 million data points that spans over 16-years of major air pollutant metrics.

# ETL - Michael


# Machine Learning Model - McKaye
1. A predictive model
2. Uses linear historical data
3. 

# Visualizations (Tableau Story Board) – Sam
1. Trend line of top 5 cities/states overall pollution levels for 16-years of historic data.
2. Top 5 most polluted cities/states levels of each major air pollutants (Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide and Ozone).
3. Geographical heat map showing air quality levels based on historic data.
4. How should we display the models’ predictions for air quality?
