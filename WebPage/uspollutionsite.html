            <h1>Introduction</h1><br>
            <p>The United States air quality index (AQI) conversation is a regular topic among news reporters, research topics, 
                and headlines. Living in cities with a lower AQI value, on a 0 to 500 scale, promotes healthy living and minimal
                 respitory issues. In comparison, cities with a higher AQI value may cause respitory issues, infections, and lower 
                 quality of living. Understanding how AQI is calculated and the factors that effect the AQI value are beneficial 
                 for preserving a good quality of life. This topic raises a question, can we predict AQI? Could this help the general 
                 public better understand AQI and assist in their choice of locality? Using government funded AQI data from the 
                 United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), can we begin to understand how AQI performs over time 
                 and make comparable predictions based on selected inputs??<br><br><br>

        <h3>Weak Relationship Between Variables</h3><br>
        <p>According to the "Top 5 Best - Linear Relationships" and the "Top 5 Worst - Linear Relationships" sections of 
            our dashboard, there is a weak relationship between our variables "Year" and "MedianAQI" for each city. 
            An example of "Bakersfield, CA" above domonstrates that each of the line graphs is set up the same for the top 5 best 
            and worst cities. The x-axis is "Year" and the y-axis is "MedianAQI". 
            Each point on the graph represents the "MedianAQI" for that corresponding "Year". The blue line is a autogenerated 
            trend line based on the data. The blue shading is the confidence intervals for each graph. 
            The confidence interval illustrates a level of uncertainty. The seaborn import during the machine learning model process 
            has a 95% confidence interval by default. 
            This mean anthything within the 95% interval is likely to be true and anything outside the confidence interval is likely 
            to be false. To have a "strong" relationship each point should lie close to the trend line and be within the confidence 
            interval. 
            However, many points do not straddle the trend line and some lie outside the confidence interval, which are likely to be 
            extreme outliers. Therefore, this data shows that a weak relationship exists between our chosen variables and a lack of 
            accuracy in predicting AQI. In addition most of the trend lines are negative weak meaning they are sloping down and the 
            points are not close to the trend line. A negative relationship illustrates a negative linear relationship between 
            "MedianAQI" and "Year". Essentialy, as "Year" increases "MedianAQI" has an inverse relationship, of decreasing.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Hypotheses for Volatility</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Wild Fire Spread:</b> these are unpredictable and negatively effect many city's AQI</li><br>
                <li><b>Covid-19 Relocations:</b> the mass movement of people across the US could be cause for extreme positive/negative spikes in certain cities</li><br>
                <li><b>Droughts:</b> such as lack of rain fall causing wild fires during summer or bodies of water drying up, which cause an increase in particles in the air</li><br>
                <li><b>Factory/Plants/Mills/etc.:</b> can all effect AQI by their emissions</li><br>

            <br><br><br><h3>Predicted vs Actual AQI Disconnect</h3><br>
            <p>According to the "Top 5 Worst Predicted vs Actual" and the "Top 5 Best Predicted vs Actual" sections of our dashboard, 
                our machine learning model was unsucessful in predicting AQI. Each top 5 best and worst city has their own graph where 
                the x-axis is "Year" and the y-axis is "MedianAQI". 
                There are two lines to show the accuracy of the "PredictedAQI" provided by the machine learning model and the "MedianAQI" 
                provided by the EPA data. The "Predicted" line is yellow with an x at each data point that represents "PredictedAQI"
                and the "Actual" line is blue with a dot over each data point that represents "MedianAQI". 
                All 10 of our cities illustrated a disconnect between the "Acutal" and "Predicted". This demonstrates that AQI cannot be 
                predicted simply alone by "Year" and "MedianAQI". This also leads us to our largest limitation for the project, 
                not having enough variables to build and teach our machine learning model to predict AQI more accurately. 
                Although we cannot draw accuracy from these graphs we can hypothesize what causes positive and negative spikes in the 
                "Actual" line that could be used to perfect the model in future research projects. See the next finding 
                "Hypotheses for Volatitlity" to see other possibly assumptions to why "Actual" and "Predicted" are vastly different, 
                seperate from lack of variables limitation.</p><br><br><br><br>

        <h1>Limitations</h1>
        <span class="square"></span>
        <h3>Limited Variables</h3><br>
        <p>When building out our project we tested if we could predict each year's "PredictedAQI" 
            based simply upon the historic "MedianAQI" and "Year" data collected by the EPA. 
            However, we determined that "PredictedAQI" can not be predicted accurately on historic "MedianAQI" 
            and "Year" values alone. There is a weak relationship between "Year" and "MedianAQI" 
            for all top 5 cities, as shown in the visuals on the "Top 5 Best - Linear Relationships" 
            and the "Top 5 Worst - Linear Relationships" sections of our dashboard. 
            Therefore more dependent variables, such as weather patterns, wind movements, emissions, etc. 
            need to be added to the machine learning formula to improve the predictive accuracy rate 
            of the indepenent variable "MedianAQI".</p><br><br>
        <h3>Technical Skill</h3><br>
        <p>During conversation between the team, all of the members were newer to the subject of data analytics, 
            computer programming, and machine learning. With only 6-months to prepare for a project of this calliber, 
            technical skill is a huge caveat to performance. We all had basic working skills for each section 
            of the project and demonstrated at our best, the knowledge we have obtained. 
            With more practice on technical skills a more refined foundation of this project may have improved 
            our predictive ability.</p><br>

    <div class="Limitations-right-col">
        <div class="Limitations-text">
            <br><br><br><h3>Time Limits</h3><br>
            <p>We believe that if more time was alloted to do data exploration and analysis, 
                that this project would prove a better accuracy rate in "PredictedAQI" for the top 5 best 
                and worst cities. 
                A project with this count of deliverables and it's highly technical nature, 
                proves difficult for many teams albeit an unfamiliar team and 4-weeks. Regardless of the
                time limit for this project, we believe we demonstrated many skills learned throughout this 
                boot camp and are proud of what we accomplished.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
